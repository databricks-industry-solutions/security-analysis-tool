# Permissions Analysis Tool Databricks App

A **Gradio-based web application** for interactive Databricks security and permission analysis.

## 🎯 Overview

Permissions Analysis Tool App provides a **user-friendly web interface** for the 7 core permission analysis capabilities from the `06_permission_analysis_enhanced.py` notebook:

1. **Quick Check** - Simple yes/no: Can user access resource?
2. **Who Can Access?** - List all principals with access to a resource
3. **What Can User Access?** - List all resources accessible to a principal
4. **Effective Permissions** - Show all permission sources and effective access level
5. **Permission Chains** - Trace all inheritance paths (recursive analysis)
6. **Full Recursive Access** - Deep dive showing direct + indirect access via groups
7. **Escalation Risk** - Identify privilege escalation paths to admin resources

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
Permissions Analysis Tool App (Gradio)
    ↓
Databricks SQL Warehouse
    ↓
Unity Catalog Tables
    • {CATALOG}.{SCHEMA}.vertices
    • {CATALOG}.{SCHEMA}.edges
```

**Data Flow:**
1. Customer runs `permission_analysis_data_collection.py` notebook (populates vertices/edges)
2. Customer deploys Permissions Analysis Tool App
3. App queries pre-collected graph data via SQL Warehouse
4. Interactive analysis via web UI

## 📋 Prerequisites

### 1. Data Collection (Required)

Run `notebooks/permission_analysis_data_collection.py` first to populate the graph data:
```
{CATALOG}.{SCHEMA}.vertices  # All Databricks objects & principals
{CATALOG}.{SCHEMA}.edges     # All relationships & permissions
```

### 2. SQL Warehouse (Required)

You need a running SQL Warehouse. The app uses it to query the graph data.

### 3. Permissions (Required)

The app service needs:
* `SELECT` on `{CATALOG}.{SCHEMA}.vertices`
* `SELECT` on `{CATALOG}.{SCHEMA}.edges`
* `SELECT` on `{CATALOG}.{SCHEMA}.collection_metadata`
* `USE CATALOG` on the configured catalog
* `USE SCHEMA` on the configured schema

**Grant permissions to the app's service principal:**

When you deploy a Databricks App, it runs with its own service principal identity. You must grant this identity access to your data tables.

```sql
-- Replace {CATALOG} and {SCHEMA} with your values (e.g., arunuc, brickhound)
-- Replace {APP_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL} with your app's service principal name

GRANT USAGE ON CATALOG {CATALOG} TO `{APP_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL}`;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA {CATALOG}.{SCHEMA} TO `{APP_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL}`;
GRANT SELECT ON SCHEMA {CATALOG}.{SCHEMA} TO `{APP_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL}`;
```

To find your app's service principal:
1. Go to **Workspace** → **Apps** → Select your app
2. Look in the app settings/configuration for the service principal name
3. It's usually named like the app or shown in the identity section

**⚠️ Important:** If you DROP and recreate the schema/tables, you must re-grant these permissions. Unity Catalog permissions are tied to specific objects and don't persist across DROP/CREATE cycles.

## 🚀 Deployment

### Option 1: Databricks Apps (Recommended)

1. **Configure app.yaml**:
   ```yaml
   # Update these values in app.yaml
   env:
     - name: BRICKHOUND_CATALOG
       value: "your_catalog"  # e.g., "main", "arunuc"
     - name: BRICKHOUND_SCHEMA
       value: "brickhound"
     - name: DATABRICKS_WAREHOUSE_HTTP_PATH
       value: "/sql/1.0/warehouses/abc123def456"
   
   resources:
     - name: default-sql-warehouse
       sql_warehouse:
         id: "abc123def456"  # Your SQL warehouse ID
   ```

2. **Deploy via Databricks CLI**:
   ```bash
   databricks apps create brickhound \
     --source-code-path ./app \
     --description "Permissions Analysis Tool"
   ```

3. **Access the App**:
   * Go to **Workspace** → **Apps** → **Permissions Analysis Tool**
   * Or use the direct URL provided after deployment

### Option 2: Local Testing

```bash
# Install dependencies
cd app/
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set environment variables
export DATABRICKS_HOST="https://your-workspace.cloud.databricks.com"
export DATABRICKS_TOKEN="dapi..."
export DATABRICKS_WAREHOUSE_HTTP_PATH="/sql/1.0/warehouses/..."
export BRICKHOUND_CATALOG="arunuc"
export BRICKHOUND_SCHEMA="brickhound"

# Run the app
python app.py
```

Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

## 🎮 Using the App

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

**Required:**
* `DATABRICKS_HOST` - Workspace URL (auto-set in Databricks Apps)
* `DATABRICKS_TOKEN` - Access token (auto-set in Databricks Apps)
* `DATABRICKS_WAREHOUSE_HTTP_PATH` - SQL Warehouse HTTP path

**Optional:**
* `BRICKHOUND_CATALOG` - Catalog name (default: "arunuc")
* `BRICKHOUND_SCHEMA` - Schema name (default: "brickhound")

### SQL Warehouse

Update `app.yaml` with your SQL Warehouse ID:
```yaml
resources:
  - name: default-sql-warehouse
    sql_warehouse:
      id: "<your-warehouse-id>"  # Find in SQL Warehouses → Details
```

## 🔒 Security Notes

### Input Sanitization
* Basic SQL injection protection via quote escaping
* Always validate inputs before queries
* Users should have READ-ONLY access to graph tables

### Access Control
* App inherits permissions from the running user/service principal
* Recommended: Deploy with a service principal that has SELECT-only access
* Never grant MODIFY/DELETE on vertices/edges tables to the app

### Data Privacy
* App reveals sensitive security information
* Restrict app access to authorized security personnel only
* Consider logging all queries for audit trail

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Error loading graph data"
**Cause:** Data tables don't exist or are empty  
**Fix:** Run `notebooks/permission_analysis_data_collection.py` first

### "Principal/Resource not found"
**Cause:** Name doesn't exactly match what's in vertices table  
**Fix:** Check exact names with: `SELECT DISTINCT name FROM {CATALOG}.{SCHEMA}.vertices WHERE node_type = 'User'`

### "No permission grants found"
**Cause:** Permission collection wasn't run or failed  
**Fix:** Re-run `permission_analysis_data_collection.py` with `collect_permissions = True`

### "Connection refused" or "Warehouse not available"
**Cause:** SQL Warehouse is stopped
**Fix:** Start the SQL Warehouse or update `app.yaml` with a running warehouse ID

### "No data collected yet" or all stats show 0
**Cause:** App's service principal doesn't have permission to read the tables
**Fix:** Grant SELECT permissions to the app's service principal:
```sql
GRANT USAGE ON CATALOG {CATALOG} TO `{APP_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL}`;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA {CATALOG}.{SCHEMA} TO `{APP_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL}`;
GRANT SELECT ON SCHEMA {CATALOG}.{SCHEMA} TO `{APP_SERVICE_PRINCIPAL}`;
```

**Tip:** Use the `/api/debug` endpoint to diagnose connection and permission issues. It shows table counts and connection status.

### Data shows in SQL editor but not in app
**Cause:** Permissions were lost after DROP/recreate of schema
**Fix:** Re-grant permissions to the app's service principal (see above). Unity Catalog permissions don't persist across DROP/CREATE cycles.

## 📊 Data Requirements

The app expects these tables to exist with the following schema:

### `{CATALOG}.{SCHEMA}.vertices`
```sql
id               STRING    -- Unique identifier
node_type        STRING    -- Type (User, Catalog, Table, etc.)
name             STRING    -- Full name
display_name     STRING    -- Display name
owner            STRING    -- Owner identifier
email            STRING    -- Email (for users)
active           BOOLEAN   -- Active status
created_at       TIMESTAMP -- Creation time
```

### `{CATALOG}.{SCHEMA}.edges`
```sql
src              STRING    -- Source vertex ID
dst              STRING    -- Destination vertex ID
relationship     STRING    -- Relationship type
permission_level STRING    -- Permission (ALL PRIVILEGES, MANAGE, etc.)
inherited        BOOLEAN   -- Is inherited permission
created_at       TIMESTAMP -- Creation time
```
