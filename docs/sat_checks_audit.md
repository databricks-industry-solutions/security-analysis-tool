# SAT Security Checks Comprehensive Audit

**Date:** 2026-02-23
**SAT Version:** 0.6.0 → 0.7.0
**Analyst:** Claude Code (AI-assisted audit)

---

## Executive Summary

This document provides a full audit of all SAT security checks, reviewed against:

- Databricks Settings v2 API (7 account-level, 16 workspace-level settings)
- Existing 47 workspace-level and 13 account-level data collections in SAT bootstrap
- 35+ workspace-conf keys already collected
- Databricks DASF framework and 2025/2026 best practices

**Net effect of this audit:**

| Action | Count |
|---|---|
| Checks removed (obsolete / platform-managed / non-security) | 7 |
| Severity upgrades | 12 |
| Severity downgrades | 5 |
| New checks added | 14 |
| **Total checks after changes** | **86** (was 79) |

---

## Phase 1: Checks Removed (7 checks)

The following checks are hard-deleted from `security_best_practices.csv`.

### INFO-12 — Manage third-party iFraming prevention

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Check ID** | INFO-12 |
| **CSV id** | 46 |
| **Reason for removal** | `enable-X-Frame-Options` is an HTTP security header managed entirely by the Databricks platform. Customers cannot meaningfully configure this via workspace-conf, and the setting has been deprecated. Keeping this check creates false confidence that it is actionable. |
| **Recommendation** | Remove permanently. |

### INFO-13 — Manage MIME type sniffing prevention

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Check ID** | INFO-13 |
| **CSV id** | 47 |
| **Reason for removal** | `enable-X-Content-Type-Options` is a platform-managed HTTP security header. Same rationale as INFO-12 — not customer-configurable in modern workspaces. |
| **Recommendation** | Remove permanently. |

### INFO-14 — Manage XSS attack page rendering prevention

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Check ID** | INFO-14 |
| **CSV id** | 48 |
| **Reason for removal** | `enable-X-XSS-Protection` is a legacy HTTP header. It was already deprecated in modern browsers and is fully managed by the Databricks platform. These three checks (INFO-12/13/14) should be removed together as they represent a legacy category of platform-managed controls. |
| **Recommendation** | Remove permanently. |

### INFO-17 — Serverless compute

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Check ID** | INFO-17 |
| **CSV id** | 61 |
| **Reason for removal** | This check verifies whether serverless compute is *available/enabled*, not whether it is configured securely. Serverless availability is an operational/cost feature, not a security posture signal. No pass/fail security implication. Enable=0 already indicates this was recognized as low-value. |
| **Recommendation** | Remove permanently. Serverless security is addressed by NS-9 (network policies) and NS-10 (new egress policy check). |

### IA-3 — Table Access Control for clusters that don't use Unity Catalog

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Check ID** | IA-3 |
| **CSV id** | 20 |
| **Reason for removal** | Hive Metastore table ACLs are being deprecated across Databricks. Customers on Unity Catalog receive confusing, misleading results from this check. GOV-12 already covers Unity Catalog cluster access mode enforcement. With UC as the platform standard, this check creates noise and recommends a control that is itself being superseded. |
| **Recommendation** | Remove permanently. For UC-based workspaces, GOV-12 and GOV-38 (new) provide equivalent and superior coverage. |

### GOV-6 — All-purpose cluster custom tags

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Check ID** | GOV-6 |
| **CSV id** | 11 |
| **Reason for removal** | Cluster tagging is a cost management and operational control, not a security control. Enable=0 already indicates this was flagged as low-value. Keeping disabled non-security checks adds noise to the audit surface without security benefit. |
| **Recommendation** | Remove permanently. Tagging enforcement belongs in cost governance tooling, not a security scanner. |

### GOV-7 — Job cluster custom tags

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Check ID** | GOV-7 |
| **CSV id** | 12 |
| **Reason for removal** | Same rationale as GOV-6. Job cluster tagging is a cost management control, not a security control. Enable=0. |
| **Recommendation** | Remove permanently. |

---

## Phase 2: Severity Changes (17 checks)

### Severity Upgrades (12 checks)

| Check ID | Check Name | Current | Proposed | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **DP-2** | Cluster instance disk encryption | Low | **Medium** | Local disk encryption protects data-at-rest on cluster ephemeral storage. Active attack vector if cluster nodes are compromised or EBS volumes are detached. Low understates the residual risk on multi-tenant shared infrastructure. |
| **DP-6** | Notebook export | Low | **Medium** | Notebook export is one of the primary data exfiltration paths for workspace users. Low is inappropriate for a direct exfiltration control. Aligns with DP-5 (results download) at Medium. |
| **DP-8** | Store interactive notebook results in customer account | Medium | **High** | When disabled, notebook results (which may contain sensitive query outputs) are stored in Databricks-managed infrastructure, outside the customer's cloud account. This is a significant data residency and privacy risk for regulated industries (HIPAA, FedRAMP, PCI-DSS). |
| **GOV-10** | Managed tables in DBFS root | Low | **Medium** | DBFS root is shared, uncontrolled storage with no per-user ACLs. Production data stored there bypasses Unity Catalog governance. The risk is governance failure enabling unauthorized access to production data. |
| **GOV-11** | DBFS mounts | Low | **Medium** | DBFS FUSE mounts bypass Unity Catalog controls entirely, creating data governance gaps. All users in the workspace can see mounted paths. Understated at Low given UC adoption. |
| **GOV-13** | Enforce User Isolation | Medium | **High** | Without User Isolation on shared clusters, users can exfiltrate data from other sessions via shared JVM memory, /tmp, or Spark driver state. This is a direct multi-tenant data leakage vector. |
| **GOV-14** | Enforce AWS IMDSv2 | Low | **High** | IMDSv2 prevents Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks that allow attackers to steal EC2 instance credentials from the instance metadata service. SSRF-to-credential-theft is an active, well-documented AWS attack vector. Databricks documentation itself recommends High priority for this setting. |
| **GOV-35** | Restrict workspace admins | Medium | **High** | The `RestrictWorkspaceAdmins` setting prevents privilege escalation. Without it, workspace admins can reassign job ownership and run-as settings arbitrarily. Admin restriction is a critical identity control in any zero-trust architecture. |
| **INFO-38** | Third-party library control | Low | **High** | Artifact allowlists directly prevent supply chain attacks — one of the most common and impactful breach vectors in data platforms. Unrestricted library installation from arbitrary sources allows malicious packages to execute with cluster privileges. Should be High. |
| **INFO-39** | Compliance security profile for the workspace | Low | **Medium** | Workspace-level CSP affects the security posture of all workloads in that workspace. Understated at Low given the systemic impact. |
| **INFO-40** | Enhanced security monitoring for the workspace | Low | **Medium** | ESM provides real-time threat detection and behavioral anomaly monitoring. Understated at Low — the capability directly reduces detection latency for attacks. |
| **NS-6** | Secure cluster connectivity (NoPublicIP) | Medium | **High** | NoPublicIP prevents cluster nodes from having public IP addresses, eliminating direct internet-accessible attack surface on compute. This should be consistent with NS-1/NS-2 (SSH key prohibition) at High, as both address direct cluster exposure. |

### Severity Downgrades (5 checks)

| Check ID | Check Name | Current | Proposed | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **DP-9** | FileStore endpoint for HTTPS file serving | Medium | **Low** | FileStore is a legacy DBFS path used for HTTP file serving. Customers rarely store sensitive data there, and the endpoint is read-only. Medium overstates the risk for most workspaces. |
| **GOV-4** | Long-running clusters | Medium | **Low** | Long-running clusters are primarily an operational waste and patching hygiene issue, not a direct security risk. The security angle (stale base images) is captured better by GOV-36 (Automatic cluster update). |
| **GOV-24** | Legacy global init script | High | **Medium** | Legacy global init scripts are deprecated and should be migrated, but their existence is not a live attack vector in most workspaces. High overstates the urgency vs. active security risks. |
| **GOV-26** | Legacy cluster-named init scripts | High | **Medium** | Same rationale as GOV-24. The deprecation is important but not an active exploitation path. |
| **INFO-37** | Compliance security profile for new workspaces (account) | Low | **Medium** | Account-level CSP affects all new workspaces created going forward. The systemic impact means Medium is more appropriate than Low. |

## Phase 3: New Checks (14 checks)

All new checks leverage data already collected by SAT's existing bootstrap infrastructure or Settings v2 API calls already implemented.

### Data Protection

#### DP-10 — Disable legacy DBFS (account setting)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Check ID** | DP-10 |
| **CSV id** | 113 |
| **Category** | Data Protection |
| **Severity** | High |
| **Cloud** | AWS, Azure, GCP |
| **Enable** | 1 |
| **Data Source** | Settings v2: `disable_legacy_dbfs` (account-level) |
| **Logic** | PASS if `disable_legacy_dbfs` account setting is enabled. DBFS root is shared, uncontrolled storage with no per-user ACLs. Disabling it at the account level prevents all new workspaces from accessing DBFS and enforces Unity Catalog as the data access layer. |
| **API** | `GET https://accounts.cloud.databricks.com/api/2.0/accounts/<account_id>/settings/types/disable_legacy_dbfs/names/default` |
| **AWS Doc** | https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/admin/account-settings/legacy-features |

| **GCP Doc** | https://docs.gcp.databricks.com/en/admin/account-settings/legacy-features |
| **DASF** | DASF-8:Encrypt data at rest |

#### DP-11 — SQL warehouse results download disabled

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Check ID** | DP-11 |
| **CSV id** | 114 |
| **Category** | Data Protection |
| **Severity** | Medium |
| **Cloud** | AWS, Azure, GCP |
| **Enable** | 1 |
| **Data Source** | Settings v2: `sql_results_download` (workspace-level) |
| **Logic** | PASS if SQL results download is disabled. Distinct from notebook results download (DP-5). Controls the ability to download query results from SQL warehouse sessions via the SQL Editor and Dashboards UI. |
| **API** | `GET https://<workspace_url>/api/2.0/settings/types/sql_results_download/names/default` |
| **AWS Doc** | https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/admin/workspace-settings/sql-results-download |

| **GCP Doc** | https://docs.gcp.databricks.com/en/admin/workspace-settings/sql-results-download |
| **DASF** | DASF-43:Use access control lists |

#### DP-12 — Web terminal disabled on clusters

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Check ID** | DP-12 |
| **CSV id** | 115 |
| **Category** | Data Protection |
| **Severity** | Medium |
| **Cloud** | AWS, Azure, GCP |
| **Enable** | 1 |
| **Data Source** | `workspacesettings` table: `enableWebTerminal` |
| **Logic** | PASS if `enableWebTerminal` workspace-conf value is `false`. The web terminal provides an interactive bash shell directly on cluster driver nodes. This allows users to read any data the cluster has access to, exfiltrate data via curl/wget, and bypass notebook audit logs. |
| **API** | `GET https://<workspace_url>/api/2.0/preview/workspace-conf?keys=enableWebTerminal` |
| **AWS Doc** | https://docs.databricks.com/clusters/web-terminal.html |
| **Azure Doc** | https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/clusters/web-terminal |
| **GCP Doc** | https://docs.gcp.databricks.com/clusters/web-terminal.html |
| **DASF** | DASF-5:Control access to data and other objects |

#### DP-13 — DBFS file browser disabled

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Check ID** | DP-13 |
| **CSV id** | 116 |
| **Category** | Data Protection |
| **Severity** | Medium |
| **Cloud** | AWS, Azure, GCP |
| **Enable** | 1 |
| **Data Source** | `workspacesettings` table: `enableDbfsFileBrowser` |
| **Logic** | PASS if `enableDbfsFileBrowser` workspace-conf value is `false`. The DBFS file browser exposes the full DBFS namespace to all workspace users through the UI, allowing browsing of shared storage paths and discovery of data without audit trail or access control. |
| **API** | `GET https://<workspace_url>/api/2.0/preview/workspace-conf?keys=enableDbfsFileBrowser` |
| **AWS Doc** | https://docs.databricks.com/administration-guide/workspace/dbfs.html |
| **Azure Doc** | https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/administration-guide/workspace/dbfs |
| **GCP Doc** | https://docs.gcp.databricks.com/administration-guide/workspace/dbfs.html |
| **DASF** | DASF-8:Encrypt data at rest |

### Governance

#### GOV-38 — Disable legacy table ACL access

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Check ID** | GOV-38 |
| **CSV id** | 117 |
| **Category** | Governance |
| **Severity** | High |
| **Cloud** | AWS, Azure, GCP |
| **Enable** | 1 |
| **Data Source** | Settings v2: `disable_legacy_access` (workspace-level) |
| **Logic** | PASS if `disable_legacy_access` setting is enabled. When disabled, users can access Hive Metastore tables using legacy table ACLs that bypass Unity Catalog governance controls. This creates a shadow data access path not visible in Unity Catalog audit logs. |
| **API** | `GET https://<workspace_url>/api/2.0/settings/types/disable_legacy_access/names/default` |
| **AWS Doc** | https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/admin/workspace-settings/disable-legacy-access |
| **Azure Doc** | https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/admin/workspace-settings/disable-legacy-access |
| **GCP Doc** | https://docs.gcp.databricks.com/en/admin/workspace-settings/disable-legacy-access |
| **DASF** | DASF-5:Control access to data and other objects |

#### GOV-39 — Personal compute policy configured

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Check ID** | GOV-39 |
| **CSV id** | 118 |
| **Category** | Governance |
| **Severity** | Medium |
| **Cloud** | AWS, Azure, GCP |
| **Enable** | 1 |
| **Data Source** | Account Settings v2: `personal_compute` |
| **Logic** | PASS if personal compute is configured with a restrictive policy (not `ALLOW_ALL`). Personal compute VMs created without a policy bypass cluster policies, cost controls, and security configuration enforcement. |
| **API** | `GET https://accounts.cloud.databricks.com/api/2.0/accounts/<account_id>/settings/types/personal_compute/names/default` |
| **AWS Doc** | https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/admin/clusters/personal-compute |
| **Azure Doc** | https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/admin/clusters/personal-compute |
| **GCP Doc** | https://docs.gcp.databricks.com/en/admin/clusters/personal-compute |
| **DASF** | DASF-38:Platform security — vulnerability management |

#### GOV-40 — AI/BI dashboard embedding policy restricted

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Check ID** | GOV-40 |
| **CSV id** | 119 |
| **Category** | Governance |
| **Severity** | Medium |
| **Cloud** | AWS, Azure, GCP |
| **Enable** | 1 |
| **Data Source** | Settings v2: `aibi_dashboard_embedding_access_policy` (workspace-level) |
| **Logic** | PASS if the embedding policy is not `ALLOW_ALL`. Unrestricted embedding allows AI/BI dashboards to be embedded on any external domain including attacker-controlled sites. This exposes workspace data to unauthenticated or cross-origin access. |
| **API** | `GET https://<workspace_url>/api/2.0/settings/types/aibi_dashboard_embedding_access_policy/names/default` |
| **AWS Doc** | https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/admin/workspace-settings/aibi-embedding |
| **Azure Doc** | https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/admin/workspace-settings/aibi-embedding |
| **GCP Doc** | https://docs.gcp.databricks.com/en/admin/workspace-settings/aibi-embedding |
| **DASF** | DASF-43:Use access control lists |

#### GOV-41 — Secret scope ACLs configured

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Check ID** | GOV-41 |
| **CSV id** | 120 |
| **Category** | Governance |
| **Severity** | High |
| **Cloud** | AWS, Azure, GCP |
| **Enable** | 1 |
| **Data Source** | `secretscope` table + secrets ACL API (already collected) |
| **Logic** | PASS if all secret scopes have explicit ACLs configured beyond the default. By default, all workspace users have READ access to all secrets in a scope. Explicit ACLs restrict which users and service principals can read specific secrets. |
| **API** | `GET https://<workspace_url>/api/2.0/secrets/acls/list?scope=<scope_name>` |
| **AWS Doc** | https://docs.databricks.com/security/secrets/secret-acl.html |
| **Azure Doc** | https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/security/secrets/secret-acl |
| **GCP Doc** | https://docs.gcp.databricks.com/security/secrets/secret-acl.html |
| **DASF** | DASF-33:Manage credentials securely |

#### GOV-42 — Jobs run as service principal

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Check ID** | GOV-42 |
| **CSV id** | 121 |
| **Category** | Governance |
| **Severity** | Medium |
| **Cloud** | AWS, Azure, GCP |
| **Enable** | 1 |
| **Data Source** | `jobs` table: `settings.run_as` field |
| **Logic** | PASS if production jobs specify `run_as` a service principal. Jobs running as user identity create implicit dependencies on the user's account being active, inherit the user's full permission set (violating least privilege), and create audit confusion between interactive and automated actions. |
| **API** | `GET https://<workspace_url>/api/2.0/jobs/list` |
| **AWS Doc** | https://docs.databricks.com/administration-guide/users-groups/service-principals.html |
| **Azure Doc** | https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/tutorials/run-jobs-with-service-principals |
| **GCP Doc** | https://docs.gcp.databricks.com/administration-guide/users-groups/service-principals.html |
| **DASF** | DASF-38:Platform security — vulnerability management |

### Identity & Access

#### IA-8 — PAT token creation restricted to admins

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Check ID** | IA-8 |
| **CSV id** | 122 |
| **Category** | Identity & Access |
| **Severity** | High |
| **Cloud** | AWS, Azure, GCP |
| **Enable** | 1 |
| **Data Source** | `workspacesettings` table: `enableTokensConfig` |
| **Logic** | PASS if non-admin users are blocked from creating PAT tokens (`enableTokensConfig = false` or workspace token policy restricts creation). Unconstrained token creation expands the credential attack surface and creates untracked long-lived credentials. Complements IA-4/IA-5/IA-6 which check token lifetimes. |
| **API** | `GET https://<workspace_url>/api/2.0/preview/workspace-conf?keys=enableTokensConfig` |
| **AWS Doc** | https://docs.databricks.com/administration-guide/access-control/tokens.html |
| **Azure Doc** | https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/administration-guide/access-control/tokens |
| **GCP Doc** | https://docs.gcp.databricks.com/administration-guide/access-control/tokens.html |
| **DASF** | DASF-33:Manage credentials securely |

#### IA-9 — Service principal client secrets not stale

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Check ID** | IA-9 |
| **CSV id** | 123 |
| **Category** | Identity & Access |
| **Severity** | High |
| **Cloud** | AWS, Azure, GCP |
| **Enable** | 1 |
| **Evaluation Value** | 365 (configurable — max days since secret creation) |
| **Data Source** | OAuth service principal secrets API |
| **Logic** | PASS if all service principal OAuth client secrets were created (or rotated) within the configured number of days (default: 365). Stale credentials increase the breach impact window — a compromised secret that was never rotated may have been exfiltrated months ago. |
| **API** | `GET https://accounts.cloud.databricks.com/api/2.0/accounts/<account_id>/servicePrincipals/<sp_id>/credentials/secrets` |
| **AWS Doc** | https://docs.databricks.com/administration-guide/users-groups/service-principals.html |
| **Azure Doc** | https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/administration-guide/users-groups/service-principals |
| **GCP Doc** | https://docs.gcp.databricks.com/administration-guide/users-groups/service-principals.html |
| **DASF** | DASF-33:Manage credentials securely |

### Network Security

#### NS-10 — Serverless compute has egress network policy

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Check ID** | NS-10 |
| **CSV id** | 124 |
| **Category** | Network Security |
| **Severity** | High |
| **Cloud** | AWS, Azure, GCP |
| **Enable** | 1 |
| **Data Source** | `account_networkpolicies` table + `workspace_network_config` (already collected) |
| **Logic** | PASS if the workspace has a network policy assigned with serverless egress controls (policy mode is not `NO_POLICY` for serverless). Serverless compute without an egress network policy can connect to any internet endpoint, creating an unrestricted data exfiltration path. Complements NS-9 which checks policy assignment and mode. |
| **API** | `GET https://accounts.cloud.databricks.com/api/2.0/accounts/<account_id>/network-policies` AND `GET https://accounts.cloud.databricks.com/api/2.0/accounts/<account_id>/workspaces/<workspace_id>/network` |
| **AWS Doc** | https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/security/network/serverless-network-security/network-policies |
| **Azure Doc** | https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/security/network/serverless-network-security/network-policies |
| **GCP Doc** | https://docs.databricks.com/gcp/en/security/network/serverless-network-security/network-policies |
| **DASF** | DASF-4:Restrict access using private link |

### Informational

#### INFO-41 — Account-level ESM enforcement

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Check ID** | INFO-41 |
| **CSV id** | 125 |
| **Category** | Informational |
| **Severity** | Medium |
| **Cloud** | AWS, Azure |
| **Enable** | 1 |
| **Data Source** | Account Settings v2: `esm_enablement_account` |
| **Logic** | PASS if Enhanced Security Monitoring is enforced at the account level (`is_enforced = true`). Account-level enforcement applies ESM to all workspaces automatically, whereas per-workspace opt-in (INFO-40) requires manual enablement on each workspace. The difference is systemic coverage. |
| **API** | `GET https://accounts.cloud.databricks.com/api/2.0/accounts/<account_id>/settings/types/shield_esm_enablement_account/names/default` |
| **AWS Doc** | https://docs.databricks.com/en/security/privacy/enhanced-security-monitoring.html |
| **Azure Doc** | https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/security/privacy/enhanced-security-monitoring |
| **GCP Doc** | N/A |
| **DASF** | DASF-50:Platform compliance |

#### INFO-42 — Git repo allowlist configured

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Check ID** | INFO-42 |
| **CSV id** | 113 |
| **Category** | Informational |
| **Severity** | Medium |
| **Cloud** | AWS, Azure, GCP |
| **Enable** | 1 |
| **Data Source** | `workspacesettings` table: `enableProjectsAllowList` + `projectsAllowList` |
| **Logic** | PASS if the Git repository allowlist is enabled (`enableProjectsAllowList = true`). Without an allowlist, workspace users can connect notebooks to any external Git repository, enabling code exfiltration to unauthorized services and introduction of malicious code from unreviewed repositories. On PASS, the actual allowed URL prefixes (from `projectsAllowList`) are included in additional details so reviewers can verify the list is properly scoped. |
| **Additional details (pass)** | `allowlist`: comma-separated allowed Git URL prefixes (e.g. `github.com/myorg,gitlab.mycompany.com`). Empty string means allowlist is enabled but no URLs have been configured yet — which is effectively the same as disabled. |
| **Additional details (fail)** | `defn`: description of the setting only. |
| **API** | `GET https://<workspace_url>/api/2.0/preview/workspace-conf?keys=enableProjectsAllowList,projectsAllowList` |
| **SDK change required** | Add `projectsAllowList` to `ws_keymap` in `ws_settings_client.py` — same API call, second key. Requires wheel rebuild. |

## Implementation Notes for Engineering

The following new checks require new bootstrap or API call additions. All others reuse existing collected data:

| Check | Requires New Data Collection |
|---|---|
| DP-10 (Disable legacy DBFS) | Settings v2 account-level call — may reuse existing account settings bootstrap |
| DP-11 (SQL results download) | Settings v2 workspace-level — new `sql_results_download` setting |
| GOV-38 (Disable legacy access) | Settings v2 workspace-level — new `disable_legacy_access` setting |
| GOV-39 (Personal compute) | Account Settings v2 — new `personal_compute` setting |
| GOV-40 (AI/BI embedding) | Settings v2 workspace-level — new `aibi_dashboard_embedding_access_policy` |
| GOV-41 (Secret scope ACLs) | Secrets ACL list per scope — `secretscope` data exists; need ACL fetch loop |
| IA-9 (SP secrets rotation) | New API call to SP credentials/secrets endpoint |
| NS-10 (Serverless egress) | `account_networkpolicies` and `workspace_network_config` already collected; new check logic |

All other new checks (DP-12, DP-13, GOV-42, IA-8, INFO-41, INFO-42) use `workspacesettings` or `jobs` data already collected by existing bootstrap.

---

## Phase 5: Bugs Found During Implementation Review

Two data-collection bugs were identified during the Phase 3 implementation work that will cause
silent failures in checks that are already wired up or planned:

### Bug 1 — `enableDeprecatedClusterNamedInitScripts` not in `ws_keymap`

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Affects** | id=65 (GOV-26, Legacy cluster-named init scripts) |
| **Problem** | `workspace_settings.py` queries `WHERE name="enableDeprecatedClusterNamedInitScripts"` but this key is absent from `ws_settings_client.py` `ws_keymap`. The `workspacesettings_<workspace_id>` table never contains this row, so the check always sees an empty DataFrame and silently passes. |
| **Fix** | Add `{"name": "enableDeprecatedClusterNamedInitScripts", "defn": "Enable or disable legacy cluster-named init scripts"}` to `ws_keymap` in `ws_settings_client.py`. |

### Bug 2 — `enableTokensConfig` not in `ws_keymap`

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Affects** | id=122 (IA-8, PAT token creation restricted to admins) |
| **Problem** | IA-8 uses `enableTokensConfig` as its data source, but this key is not in `ws_settings_client.py`. IA-8 cannot be implemented until the key is added. |
| **Fix** | Add `{"name": "enableTokensConfig", "defn": "Enable or disable the ability of non-admin users to create personal access tokens."}` to `ws_keymap`. |

---

## Phase 6: Additional Recommended Checks (Post-v0.7.0 Backlog)

These checks were identified during a systematic review of all workspace-conf keys collected by
`ws_settings_client.py` versus keys that have corresponding check logic. All Tier 1 checks use
data already in the `workspacesettings_<workspace_id>` table — no new bootstrap work is needed.

**Summary:**

| ID | Check ID | Category | Check Name | Severity | Data Available? |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 114 | GOV-43 | Governance | Libraries on shared UC clusters restricted | **High** | ✅ Already collected |
| 115 | DP-15 | Data Protection | MLflow artifact download disabled | Medium | ✅ Already collected |
| 116 | DP-16 | Data Protection | File upload UI disabled | Low | ✅ Already collected |
| 117 | DP-17 | Data Protection | Databricks Container Services restricted | Medium | ✅ Already collected |
| 118 | NS-11 | Network Security | Account IP access list enforcement enabled | Medium | Needs bootstrap add |
| 119 | INFO-43 | Informational | AI Gateway enforcement enabled | Medium | Needs bootstrap add |
| 120 | INFO-44 | Informational | Dashboard email subscriptions restricted | Low | Needs bootstrap add |

### Tier 1 — Zero new data collection required

#### GOV-43 (id=127) — Libraries on shared Unity Catalog clusters restricted

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Check ID** | GOV-43 |
| **CSV id** | 114 |
| **Category** | Governance |
| **Severity** | High |
| **Cloud** | AWS, Azure, GCP |
| **Enable** | 1 |
| **Data Source** | `workspacesettings` table: `enableLibraryAndInitScriptOnSharedCluster` |
| **Logic** | PASS if `enableLibraryAndInitScriptOnSharedCluster` value is `false`. UC shared access mode enforces per-user data isolation at the Spark layer. Allowing user-installed libraries or init scripts breaks that guarantee: a library installed by one user executes in the shared JVM and can intercept Spark tasks, read `/tmp` contents, or exfiltrate data from co-tenant sessions. This directly undermines the isolation model that makes shared clusters multi-tenant safe. |

| **DASF** | DASF-5:Control access to data and other objects |

#### DP-15 (id=128) — MLflow artifact download disabled

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Check ID** | DP-15 |
| **CSV id** | 115 |
| **Category** | Data Protection |
| **Severity** | Medium |
| **Cloud** | AWS, Azure, GCP |
| **Enable** | 1 |
| **Data Source** | `workspacesettings` table: `mlflowRunArtifactDownloadEnabled` |
| **Logic** | PASS if `mlflowRunArtifactDownloadEnabled` value is `false`. Completes the results-download trifecta alongside DP-5 (notebook results) and DP-11 (SQL results). MLflow artifacts logged during training runs can include model weights, evaluation datasets, SHAP values, and other objects derived from sensitive training data. Disabling artifact download prevents exfiltration of these artifacts while still allowing in-UI viewing. |

#### DP-16 (id=129) — File upload UI disabled

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Check ID** | DP-16 |
| **CSV id** | 116 |
| **Category** | Data Protection |
| **Severity** | Low |
| **Cloud** | AWS, Azure, GCP |
| **Enable** | 1 |
| **Data Source** | `workspacesettings` table: `enableUploadDataUis` |
| **Logic** | PASS if `enableUploadDataUis` value is `false`. The data upload UI lets users push arbitrary files directly to DBFS from the browser, bypassing Unity Catalog lineage tracking, data quality gates, and schema enforcement. Beyond governance gaps, it can be used to introduce malicious payloads (CSV injection, crafted Parquet files to exploit downstream parsers). |

| **DASF** | DASF-5:Control access to data and other objects |

#### DP-17 (id=130) — Databricks Container Services restricted

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Check ID** | DP-17 |
| **CSV id** | 117 |
| **Category** | Data Protection |
| **Severity** | Medium |
| **Cloud** | AWS, Azure, GCP |
| **Enable** | 1 |
| **Data Source** | `workspacesettings` table: `enableDcs` |
| **Logic** | PASS if `enableDcs` value is `false`. DCS lets users launch clusters with arbitrary Docker images from any external registry (Docker Hub, ECR, GHCR, etc.). A malicious or supply-chain-compromised image can contain backdoors, keyloggers, or credential stealers that execute with full cluster IAM role privileges. Unlike library-level attacks, a compromised base image executes before Databricks security controls are applied. |

| **DASF** | DASF-5:Control access to data and other objects |

### Tier 2 — Small new bootstrap additions required

#### NS-11 (id=131) — Account-level IP access list enforcement enabled

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Check ID** | NS-11 |
| **CSV id** | 118 |
| **Category** | Network Security |
| **Severity** | Medium |
| **Cloud** | AWS, Azure, GCP |
| **Enable** | 1 |
| **Data Source** | Account Settings V2: `enable_ip_access_lists` |
| **Logic** | PASS if the IP access list enforcement feature is enabled at the account level. NS-8 checks whether IP access list entries exist, but if the enforcement feature itself is disabled, all configured lists are inert. An admin can configure lists (passing NS-8) while enforcement is off, creating a false sense of security. This is the precondition check for NS-8. |
| **API** | `GET https://accounts.cloud.databricks.com/api/2.0/accounts/<account_id>/settings/types/enable_ip_access_lists/names/default` |

| **GCP Doc** | https://docs.gcp.databricks.com/security/network/ip-access-list.html |
| **DASF** | DASF-4:Restrict access using private link |
| **Bootstrap** | New `get_enable_ip_access_lists()` in `accounts_settings.py` + bootstrap call in `accounts_bootstrap.py` |

#### INFO-43 (id=132) — AI Gateway enforcement enabled

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Check ID** | INFO-43 |
| **CSV id** | 119 |
| **Category** | Informational |
| **Severity** | Medium |
| **Cloud** | AWS, Azure |
| **Enable** | 1 |
| **Data Source** | Account Settings V2: `llm_proxy_partner_powered_enforce` |
| **Logic** | PASS if AI Gateway enforcement is enabled (`is_enforced = true`). Databricks AI Gateway provides centralized governance for LLM API calls: rate limiting, PII detection, guardrails, and audit logging. Without account-level enforcement, individual workspaces can bypass the gateway and route LLM requests directly to OpenAI/Anthropic/etc., sending potentially sensitive data to unaudited external endpoints. Especially relevant for regulated industries. Note: only meaningful when org is actively using AI Gateway. |
| **API** | `GET https://accounts.cloud.databricks.com/api/2.0/accounts/<account_id>/settings/types/llm_proxy_partner_powered_enforce/names/default` |

| **DASF** | DASF-43:Use access control lists |
| **Bootstrap** | New `get_llm_proxy_enforcement()` in `accounts_settings.py` + bootstrap call in `accounts_bootstrap.py` |

#### INFO-44 (id=133) — Dashboard email subscriptions restricted

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Check ID** | INFO-44 |
| **CSV id** | 120 |
| **Category** | Informational |
| **Severity** | Low |
| **Cloud** | AWS, Azure, GCP |
| **Enable** | 1 |
| **Data Source** | Workspace Settings V2: `dashboard_email_subscriptions` |
| **Logic** | PASS when dashboard email subscriptions are restricted or disabled. Scheduled email delivery of AI/BI dashboard results can automatically send query outputs (potentially containing PII, financial data, or trade secrets) to any email address on a recurring schedule. This is a data exfiltration risk similar to notebook export (DP-6) and results download (DP-5/DP-11), but via an automated email channel that may evade DLP monitoring. |
| **API** | `GET https://<workspace_url>/api/2.0/settings/types/dashboard_email_subscriptions/names/default` |

| **DASF** | DASF-5:Control access to data and other objects |
| **Bootstrap** | New `get_dashboard_email_subscriptions()` in `ws_settings_client.py` + bootstrap call in `workspace_bootstrap.py` |

### Workspace-conf keys reviewed and NOT recommended

| Key | Reason not recommended |
|---|---|
| `heapAnalyticsAdminConsent` / `intercomAdminConsent` | Third-party product analytics with contractual DPAs. Not an actionable security control; no meaningful pass/fail security posture signal. |
| `enableHlsRuntime` | Genomics runtime availability. Not a security control. |
| `enableGp3` | AWS EBS volume type preference. Not a security control. |
| `enableJobsEmailsV2` | Email notification format version. Not a security control. |
| `mlflowModelServingEndpointCreationEnabled` | Restricting endpoint creation is operational governance, not a data security control. |
| `mlflowModelRegistryEmailNotificationsEnabled` | Email notification opt-in. Not a security control. |
| `jobsListBackendPaginationEnabled` | Backend pagination feature flag. Not a security control. |
| `enableDatabricksAutologgingAdminConf` | Auto-logging is a productivity feature; disabling it does not reduce data security posture. |
| `aibi_dashboard_embedding_approved_domains` | Domain allowlist is context-dependent; no universal pass/fail. GOV-40 covers whether any embedding is allowed. |

## Phase 7: New Checks — CBI Ingress, Cross-Geo, PAT Lifetime, AI/ML Audit (Post-v0.7.0)

**Sources:** Product dashboard additions (CBI, cross-geo processing, PAT lifetime columns/metrics)
and Ares Management customer deep-dive feedback (remove confusing checks, clarify wording, add
AI/ML guardrail checks for FMAPI and Genie).

### Summary

| ID | Check ID | Category | Check Name | Severity | Data Available? |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 121 | NS-12 | Network Security | Context-Based Ingress (CBI) policy configured | High | ✅ Already in `account_networkpolicies` |
| 122 | IA-10 | Identity & Access | Maximum PAT token lifetime ≤ 90 days | Medium | ✅ Already in `workspacesettings` |
| 123 | GOV-44 | Governance | Model serving inference tables enabled | Low | ✅ Already in `model_serving_endpoints` |
| 124 | NS-13 | Network Security | Cross-Geo processing restricted for AI Designated Services | Medium | ⚠️ Settings V2 type name TBD |

Additionally: **IA-5 `evaluation_value` should be updated to `90`** (CSV-only change — no code needed).

---

### CSV-Only Fix: Tighten IA-5 threshold to 90 days

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Check ID** | IA-5 |
| **Change** | Set `evaluation_value` from current value → `90` |
| **Rationale** | The product standard (surfaced in the `percent_workspaces_with_pat_tokens_less_than_91d` metric) is 91 days. IA-5 currently checks whether any max-lifetime limit is set, but does not enforce how short it is. A workspace with `maxTokenLifetimeDays = 180` passes IA-5 today. Updating `evaluation_value` to 90 makes the check flag workspaces above the 90-day threshold. IA-10 (below) provides a separate explicit check for the same boundary. |

---

### Tier 1 — Zero new data collection required

#### NS-12 (id=121) — Context-Based Ingress (CBI) policy configured

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Check ID** | NS-12 |
| **CSV id** | 121 |
| **Category** | Network Security |
| **Severity** | High |
| **Cloud** | AWS, Azure, GCP |
| **Enable** | 1 |
| **Status** | CBI is Public Preview as of Dec 2025 — enable check now, monitor for GA |
| **Data Source** | `account_networkpolicies` table: `ingress.restriction_mode` (already in explicit schema at `accounts_bootstrap.py` lines 250–254) |
| **Logic** | PASS if the network policy assigned to the workspace has `ingress.restriction_mode = 'RESTRICTED_ACCESS'`. VIOLATION if no policy is assigned or ingress mode is `FULL_ACCESS`. Context-Based Ingress controls who can call Databricks APIs and reach the workspace UI based on a combination of identity (user/SP/group), network source (IP/CIDR), and access scope (UI, REST API, Apps, Lakehouse Compute). Without CBI, any authenticated identity can call the workspace from any network. Complements NS-9 (which checks egress only). Both NS-9 and NS-12 evaluate the same `account_networkpolicies` table — NS-12 evaluates the `ingress` subtree instead of `egress`. |
| **API** | `GET https://accounts.cloud.databricks.com/api/2.0/accounts/<account_id>/network-policies` |
| **AWS Doc** | https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/security/network/front-end/context-based-ingress |

| **GCP Doc** | https://docs.gcp.databricks.com/en/security/network/front-end/context-based-ingress |
| **DASF** | DASF-4:Restrict access using private link |
| **Bootstrap change** | None. `ingress.restriction_mode` is already in the explicit schema. Check logic mirrors NS-9's SQL but queries `np.ingress.restriction_mode` instead of `np.egress.network_access.restriction_mode`. |

#### IA-10 (id=122) — Maximum PAT token lifetime ≤ 90 days

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Check ID** | IA-10 |
| **CSV id** | 122 |
| **Category** | Identity & Access |
| **Severity** | Medium |
| **Cloud** | AWS, Azure, GCP |
| **Enable** | 1 |
| **Evaluation value** | 90 |
| **Data Source** | `workspacesettings` table: `maxTokenLifetimeDays` (already collected) |
| **Logic** | PASS if `maxTokenLifetimeDays` is set AND its numeric value ≤ 90. IA-5 checks whether any finite token lifetime limit exists at all; IA-10 enforces that the limit meets the 91-day industry standard. A workspace with `maxTokenLifetimeDays = 180` passes IA-5 but fails IA-10. Both checks are needed: IA-5 catches the "no limit at all" case, IA-10 catches the "limit is too permissive" case. |

| **GCP Doc** | https://docs.gcp.databricks.com/administration-guide/access-control/tokens.html |
| **DASF** | DASF-33:Manage credentials securely |
| **Bootstrap change** | None. `maxTokenLifetimeDays` is already in `workspacesettings`. |

| **Cloud** | AWS, Azure, GCP |
| **Enable** | 1 |
| **Data Source** | `model_serving_endpoints` table: `auto_capture_config.enabled` field (already bootstrapped) |
| **Logic** | PASS if ALL model serving endpoints have `auto_capture_config.enabled = true`. Applies to all endpoint types (Foundation Model, External Model, custom). Inference tables capture every request and response sent to serving endpoints, creating the audit trail needed to detect data exfiltration via model queries, prompt injection, or misuse of Foundation Model APIs. Without inference tables there is no forensic record of what data was sent to which model. This is the AI/ML equivalent of audit log enablement (GOV-3/GOV-15). |

### Tier 2 — Requires Settings V2 type name discovery

#### NS-13 (id=124) — Cross-Geo processing restricted for AI Designated Services

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Check ID** | NS-13 |
| **CSV id** | 124 |
| **Category** | Network Security |
| **Severity** | Medium |
| **Cloud** | AWS, Azure, GCP |
| **Enable** | 1 |
| **Data Source** | Workspace Settings V2 — type name **TBD** |
| **Logic** | PASS if cross-Geo processing is restricted, meaning Foundation Model API, Genie, and other Designated Services are not permitted to process data outside the workspace's geographic region. This is the primary data residency control for AI features. For workspaces in US/EU Geos the default is already restricted; the check catches workspaces outside US/EU or where the default was overridden, which is a data sovereignty risk for regulated industries (HIPAA, GDPR, PCI-DSS). |
| **Default behavior** | Restricted (on) for US/EU workspaces; unrestricted (off) for workspaces in other Geos without Compliance Security Profile. |
| **Blocker** | The exact Settings V2 type name is not publicly documented. Discover via `list_settings_metadata` MCP tool or Databricks account console → workspace Security & Compliance tab. Once confirmed, add method to `ws_settings_client.py` + bootstrap call in `workspace_bootstrap.py`. |

### Ares Customer Feedback: Action Items

#### 1. Outdated/Inapplicable Checks (Customer Confusion)

The most common source of confusion is cloud-specific checks showing for the wrong cloud type.
Verify that the `aws`/`azure`/`gcp` columns in `security_best_practices.csv` are correct for
each check and that SAT's cloud-type filter excludes them before display:

| Check | Cloud Flag to Verify |
|---|---|
| GOV-14 — Enforce AWS IMDSv2 | `aws=1, azure=0, gcp=0` |
| NS-6 — Secure cluster connectivity (NoPublicIP) | `aws=0, azure=1, gcp=0` |
| GOV-3 — Log delivery configurations | `aws=1, azure=1, gcp=0` |
| DP-3 — Customer-managed keys for managed services | `aws=1, azure=0, gcp=0` |
| INFO-37 — Compliance security profile (account) | `aws=1, azure=0, gcp=0` |
| INFO-39/INFO-40/INFO-41 — CSP/ESM workspace+account | `aws=1, azure=1, gcp=0` |

Also review checks with `enable=0` — consider removing from output entirely rather than
surfacing as disabled, since disabled checks with visible check IDs confuse customers.

#### 2. Wording Clarification (Priority Candidates)

| Check | Wording Issue |
|---|---|
| NS-9 — Workspaces have proper network policy configuration | "Proper" is vague. Reword to: "Workspaces have serverless egress network policy assigned and enforced." |
| GOV-13 — Enforce User Isolation | Name doesn't make clear this is about shared clusters. Suggest: "Shared clusters use UC isolation mode (not No Isolation Shared)." |
| INFO-38 — Third-party library control | "Artifact allowlists" as the underlying mechanism is unfamiliar. Suggest: "Workspace artifact allowlist restricts library installation to approved sources." |
| IA-4 — PAT tokens with no lifetime limit | Wording implies "no limit" is the violation — but customers read it as "tokens that have no limit" being checked, which is correct. However, the recommendation text could be clearer that unlimited-lifetime tokens are the problem. |
| GOV-10/GOV-11 — DBFS root / DBFS mounts | These appear redundant to customers who don't understand the distinction. Add explicit note: "DBFS root (GOV-10) = Hive Metastore managed table location. DBFS mounts (GOV-11) = FUSE mount points bypassing UC." |

#### 3. AI/ML Guardrails (FMAPI and Genie)

Key findings from research:

- **Foundation Model API (FMAPI):** No workspace-level admin toggle for safety filters — those are per-request parameters. The meaningful admin controls are: (a) inference table logging (GOV-44 above), (b) cross-Geo data residency (NS-13 above), (c) IP access list enforcement (NS-5, already checked). No additional FMAPI-specific admin check is feasible with current APIs.

- **Genie (AI/BI):** Security is governed by Unity Catalog table permissions (already covered by GOV-12/22), IP access lists (NS-5), and the AI/BI embedding policy (GOV-40). No separate Genie-specific admin security toggle exists. A Genie space permissions check (verifying explicit CAN_VIEW/CAN_MANAGE assignments per space) is technically possible via `GET /api/2.0/genie/spaces/{id}/permissions` but is expensive at scale (one API call per space) and deferred pending Genie API GA and bulk permission retrieval support.

- **Recommended messaging for customers:** Frame GOV-44 (inference tables) and NS-13 (cross-geo) as the primary AI/ML guardrail additions. These directly address the "what data is being sent to AI services and is it leaving my region?" concerns.

### Not Recommended (Phase 7)

| Item | Reason |
|---|---|
| FMAPI safety filter check | `enable_safety_filter` is a per-request parameter, not an admin workspace setting. |
| Genie space permissions check | One API call per space — too expensive at scale. Defer pending bulk API. |
| Composite "frontend network protection" check | NS-3 + NS-5 + NS-12 individually provide clearer remediation paths. Composite belongs in the dashboard scoring layer, not the check table. |
| `mlflowModelServingEndpointCreationEnabled` (as FMAPI control) | Disabling this disables ALL model serving (not just FMAPI). Too broad as a security recommendation. Already in Phase 6 as DP-17 for the data protection angle. |
