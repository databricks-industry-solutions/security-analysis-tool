# FAQs

1. **Can SAT make modifications to my workspaces and account?**

    No. SAT is meant to be a readonly analysis tool, it does not make changes to your workspace or account configurations.

2. **I added a new workspace for analysis, re-ran steps under initialize and driver, but the dashboard is not updated with the new workspace in the pulldown even though I see new data generated by the analysis scan for the new workspace in SAT database. What should I do?**

    It is likely that the Dashboard cached the workspaces in the pulldown. You can go to SQL view of your workspace -> Queries -> find `workspace_ids` query and run it, that should refresh and have the new workspaces in the pull-down.

## Troubleshooting

We created diagnosis notebooks for respective clouds to help troubleshoot your SAT setup. Please go to Workspace -> Applications -> SAT -> files -> notebooks -> diagnosis/ folder and run the respective cloud `sat_diagnosis_` notebook.

### Incorrectly configured secrets

* **Error:**

    ```
    Secret does not exist with scope: sat_scope and key: sat_tokens
    ```

* **Resolution:**

    Check if the tokens are configured with the correct names by listing and comparing with the configuration.
    ```
    databricks --profile e2-sat secrets list-secrets sat_scope
    ```

### Firewall blocking Databricks accounts console

* **Error:**

    During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:
    ```

* **Resolution:**

    Run this following command in your notebook:
    ```
    %sh 
    curl -X GET -H "Authorization: Basic /<base64 of userid:password/>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" https://accounts.cloud.databricks.com/api/2.0/accounts/<account_id>/workspaces
    ```

    or

    ```
    %sh 
    curl -u 'user:password' -X GET "Content-Type: application/json" https://accounts.cloud.databricks.com/api/2.0/accounts/<account_id>/workspaces
    ```

    If you donâ€™t see a JSON with a clean listing of workspaces, you are likely having a firewall issue that is blocking calls to the accounts console. Please have your infrastructure team add `accounts.cloud.databricks.com` to the allow-list. Ensure that the private IPv4 address from the NAT gateway is added to the IP allow list.

### Offline install of libraries in case of no PyPI access

* **Steps:**

    1. Download the `dbl_sat_sdk` version specified in the notebook `notebooks/utils/initialize` from PyPi:
        ```
        https://pypi.org/project/dbl-sat-sdk/
        ```

    2. Upload the `dbl_sat_sdk-w.x.y-py3-none-any.whl` to a `dbfs` location. You can use the `databricks-cli` as one mechanism to upload. For example:
        ```
        databricks --profile e2-satfs cp /localdrive/whlfile/dbl_sat_sdk-w.x.y-py3-none-any.whl dbfs:/FileStore/wheels/
        ```

    3. Additionally, download the following wheel files and upload them to the `dbfs` location as above:
        ```
        https://github.com/databricks-industry-solutions/security-analysis-tool/tree/main/docs/wheels
        ```

    4. Upload all wheel files to `/FileStore/wheels` in your workspace.

    5. Verify all files are there by running:

        ```
        %fs ls /FileStore/wheels
        ```

    6. Then change the cell in your notebook `install_sat_sdk` to this:

        ```python
        %pip install cachetools --find-links /dbfs/FileStore/wheels/cachetools-5.3.1-py3-none-any.whl

        %pip install pyasn1 --find-links /dbfs/FileStore/wheels/pyasn1-0.5.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl
        
        %pip install pyasn1-modules --find-links /dbfs/FileStore/wheels/pyasn1_modules-0.3.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl
        
        %pip install rsa --find-links /dbfs/FileStore/wheels/rsa-4.9-py3-none-any.whl
        
        %pip install google-auth --find-links /dbfs/FileStore/wheels/google_auth-2.22.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl
        
        %pip install PyJWT[crypto] --find-links /dbfs/FileStore/wheels/PyJWT-2.8.0-py3-none-any.whl
        
        %pip install msal --find-links /dbfs/FileStore/wheels/msal-1.22.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl
        
        %pip install dbl-sat-sdk==0.1.34 --find-links /dbfs/FileStore/wheels/dbl_sat_sdk-0.1.34-py3-none-any.whl
        ```

    7. Make sure the versions for the above libraries match.
