## Prerequisites

Before setting up SAT on Azure, ensure you have the appropriate permissions in your Azure cloud account to create the necessary resources.

> SAT is beneficial for customers on **Databricks Premium or Enterprise**, as most checks and recommendations involve security features available in higher tiers than Standard.

### App Registration

Create an App Registration in Azure to allow SAT to authenticate with Azure services. Follow these steps:

1. **Open Azure Portal:**
   - Navigate to **Microsoft Entra ID**.
  
2. **Create New App Registration:**
   - Click on **App registrations**.
   - Click on **New registration**.
   - Enter a name for the App Registration.
   - Select the appropriate permissions (minimum requirement: access in a single tenant).

### App Client Secrets

Create a client secret for the App Registration to authenticate with Azure services. Follow these steps:

1. **Open the App Registration:**
   - Select the App Registration you created.

2. **Create Client Secret:**
   - Click on **Certificates & secrets**.
   - Click on **New client secret**.
   - Enter a description for the client secret.
   - Select the expiry date.
   - Click **Add**.

3. **Save Client Secret:**
   - Copy the value of the client secret.
   - Save it in a secure location.

4. **Assign Role:**
   - Add the created Service Principal with the "Reader" role at the subscription level via **Access control (IAM)**.
   - Use [Role assignments](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal#step-2-open-the-add-role-assignment-page).

### Add Service Principal to Databricks

Add the App Registration as a service principal in Databricks. Follow these steps:

1. **Go to Account Console:**
   - Visit the [Account Console](https://accounts.azuredatabricks.net/).

2. **User Management:**
   - In the left sidebar menu, click **User management**.

3. **Add Service Principal:**
   - Select **Service Principal**.
   - Click **Add service principal**.

4. **Service Principal Type:**
   - Select **Microsoft Entra ID Managed Application**.

5. **App Client ID:**
   - Paste the App Client ID.
   - Create a new name for the service principal.
   - Click **Add**.

6. **Assign Roles:**
   - Grant the Service Principal the `Account Admin` role to manage account-level settings and permissions.
   - Assign the `Workspace Admin` role to the Service Principal for each workspace it will manage.
   - Add the Service Principal to the `Metastore Admin` group or role to manage metastore-level settings and permissions.

> The Service Principal requires an [Accounts Admin role](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/admin/users-groups/service-principals#--assign-account-admin-roles-to-a-service-principal), an [Admin role](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/admin/users-groups/service-principals#assign-a-service-principal-to-a-workspace-using-the-account-console) for **each workspace**, and must be a member of the [metastore admin group](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/data-governance/unity-catalog/manage-privileges/admin-privileges#who-has-metastore-admin-privileges) to analyze many of the APIs.

## Installation

### Credentials Needed

To set up SAT on Azure, you will need the following credentials:

- **Databricks Account ID**
- **Azure Tenant ID**
- **Azure Subscription ID**
- **Azure App Client ID** (obtained from App Registration)
- **Azure App Client Secret** (obtained from App Client Secrets)

### Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to execute SAT:

1. **Clone the SAT Repository:**
   
   Clone the SAT repository to your local machine using the following command:
   
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/databricks-industry-solutions/security-analysis-tool.git
   ```

> **Note:** Ensure the target workspace has a [profile](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/dev-tools/cli/profiles) set up in the [Databricks CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/dev-tools/cli/tutorial).

2. **Run the `install.sh` script on your terminal:**

> To ensure that the install.sh script is executable, you need to modify its permissions using the chmod command.

   ```sh
   chmod +x install.sh
   ./install.sh
   ```
