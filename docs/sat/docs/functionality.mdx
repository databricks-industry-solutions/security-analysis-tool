# Functionality

The **Security Analysis Tool (SAT)** is an observability utility designed to improve the security posture of Databricks deployments. It helps you identify deviations from established security best practices and monitor the security health of your Databricks workspaces.

<Admonition type="tip" title="Proactive Security Monitoring">
Running SAT as a routine scan across all workspaces builds confidence — especially when onboarding sensitive datasets and workflows — by ensuring that critical security gaps are addressed proactively.

## How SAT Works

SAT is typically run daily as an automated workflow within your environment. Here's what it does:

<div style={{marginLeft: '1.5rem', marginTop: '1rem'}}>

**📊 Data Collection**  
Collects configuration details from Databricks accounts and workspaces via REST APIs.

**💾 Historical Tracking**  
Persists results in Delta tables within your storage environment for historical tracking and trend analysis.

**📈 Centralized Reporting**  
Displays results in a centralized Databricks SQL dashboard, categorized into five distinct sections to help stakeholders review relevant workspace settings.

## Security Categories & Severity Levels

<Admonition type="info" title="Comprehensive Coverage">
SAT evaluates over **60 security best practices** across five key categories, with more being added regularly.
</Admonition>

Data from all configured workspaces is consolidated and presented through a single-pane SQL Dashboard. All findings are organized into the following categories:

**Security Pillars:**
- 🛡️ **Network Security**
- 👥 **Identity & Access**
- 🔐 **Data Protection**
- ⚖️ **Governance**
- ℹ️ **Informational**

**Severity Levels:**
- 🔴 **High** - Critical issues requiring immediate attention
- 🟡 **Medium** - Important issues to address soon
- 🟢 **Low** - Minor issues for continuous improvement

This structured view helps stakeholders quickly assess risk areas and prioritize remediation efforts across multiple workspaces.

## Dashboard Components

The SAT dashboard is organized into intuitive sections, each designed to help you quickly assess your security posture across all workspaces.

<AccordionItem question="Workspace Security Summary">

A high-level overview of security findings, broken down by category and categorized by **severity** (High, Medium, Low). This provides an at-a-glance view of the overall security health of each workspace.

**What you'll see:**
- Summary counts per security category
- Color-coded severity indicators
- Quick comparison across workspaces

</AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem question="Workspace Stats">

Displays essential metadata about the analysis run, helping you understand the context of your security findings.

**Information included:**
- ⏰ Timestamp of the Analysis
- 🏢 Workspace Name
- 💼 Service/Pricing Tier
- 🌍 Cloud Region

</AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem question="Individual Security Category Details">

Each of the five security pillars includes comprehensive information to help you understand and address security issues.

**What each section includes:**
- Summary counts of deviations from security best practices
- Detailed table of security findings, sorted by severity
- Description of each issue
- Links to relevant documentation for remediation guidance

</AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem question="Informational Section">

This section highlights observations that are less prescriptive but still valuable for in-depth security reviews.

**Purpose:**
These findings can be reviewed by data and security teams to ensure thresholds and configurations align with organizational policies. Not all informational findings require action, but they provide valuable context for security decision-making.

</AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem question="Additional Finding Details">

Provides deep-dive information to help pinpoint the root cause of specific findings, including the logic used to detect each issue.

**Example:**  
If the finding is "Cluster policy not used", the dashboard will list the specific cluster workloads where no policy was applied — eliminating the guesswork and enabling simplified remediation.

</AccordionItem>

## Detection Example

Let's look at how SAT identifies and presents security findings in practice.

<Admonition type="note" title="Real-World Example">
The example below shows how SAT highlights security issues with clear visual indicators and actionable remediation guidance.
</Admonition>

**Two findings shown:**

**🔴 Deprecated Runtime Versions**  
This check is marked **red**, indicating that some workloads are using deprecated Databricks runtime versions. While such workloads may continue to run, they will no longer receive support or security patches from Databricks. The **Remediation** column explains the risk and provides a link to the official documentation listing currently supported runtime versions.

**✅ Log Delivery**  
This check is marked **green**, confirming that the workspace configuration aligns with Databricks' security best practices for log delivery.

<div className='bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg mb-6'>
 <img src={useBaseUrl('/img/sat_detection_partial.png')} alt="Security Detection Dashboard" />
</div>

### Drilling Down into Details

Customers can use the **Additional Details** section to view specific configuration settings or controls that caused a best practice check to fail.

**Example 1: Deprecated Runtime Versions**  
The image below shows additional context for this check, allowing administrators to quickly identify and investigate the affected workloads.

<div className='bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg mb-6'>
 <img src={useBaseUrl('/img/additional_details_1.png')} alt="Additional Details Example 1" />
</div>

**Example 2: Log Delivery (GOV-3)**  
Customers can learn more about the **"Log Delivery"** check by referencing its identifier, **GOV-3**.

<div className='bg-gray-100 p-4 rounded-lg mb-6'>
 <img src={useBaseUrl('/img/additional_details_2.png')} alt="Additional Details Example 2" />
</div>

<Admonition type="tip" title="Continuous Improvement">
Regularly running SAT checks enables a comprehensive view of your Databricks account and workspace security posture. It also supports **continuous improvement** by helping you detect and resolve potential security risks early.
</Admonition>

## Security Configuration Comparison

<Admonition type="info" title="Track Your Progress">
This feature enables side-by-side comparison of two SAT runs across all security dimensions, helping you identify improvements and regressions over time.
</Admonition>

This drill-down view helps identify which best practice checks have **improved** or **regressed**, allowing security teams to take timely action.

**What to look for:**

**✅ Improvements**  
Cross marks (❌) turning into check marks (✓) reflect better alignment with best practices.

**⚠️ Regressions**  
Check marks (✓) turning into cross marks (❌) signal degradation and should be investigated immediately. Alerts are automatically triggered for critical regressions, notifying relevant stakeholders via email.

**Example:**  
The diagram below highlights changes in individual checks across categories. The red rectangle illustrates an **improvement** in the **"Enforce User Isolation"** check, while also showing a **regression** in the **"Admin Count"** best practice.
