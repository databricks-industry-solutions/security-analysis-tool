# Functionality

The **Security Analysis Tool (SAT)** is an observability utility designed to improve the security posture of Databricks deployments. It helps you identify deviations from established security best practices and monitor the security health of your Databricks workspaces.

## How SAT Works

SAT is typically run daily as an automated workflow within your environment:

* **Data Collection**  
  Collects configuration details from Databricks accounts and workspaces via REST APIs.

* **Historical Tracking**  
  Persists results in Delta tables within your storage environment for historical tracking and trend analysis.

* **Centralized Reporting**  
  Displays results in a centralized Databricks SQL dashboard, categorized into five distinct sections to help stakeholders review relevant workspace settings.

## Security Categories

SAT evaluates over **60 security best practices** across five key categories:

* **Network Security** - Network policies, VPC configurations, and network isolation
* **Identity & Access** - User management, group memberships, and access controls
* **Data Protection** - Encryption, data classification, and data governance
* **Governance** - Compliance, audit logging, and policy enforcement
* **Informational** - Observations and recommendations for continuous improvement

**Severity Levels:**
* **High** - Critical issues requiring immediate attention
* **Medium** - Important issues to address soon
* **Low** - Minor issues for continuous improvement
