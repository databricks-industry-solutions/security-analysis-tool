# Executive Dashboard

The **Executive Dashboard** is a streamlined, high-level view designed for stakeholders and executives who need a quick overview of the security posture without getting into technical details.

## Overview

In addition to the comprehensive SAT dashboard, an **Executive Dashboard** is also provided. This view consolidates key findings from the complete dashboard and presents them in an easy-to-digest format that's perfect for leadership and business stakeholders.

You can use **Databricks One** to access and share the SAT dashboards across your organization, making it easier to distribute security insights to stakeholders.

The Executive Dashboard enables leadership to:

## Dashboard Configuration

The Executive Dashboard follows the same configuration process as the General Dashboard:

1. Click on the dashboard and in the top right, click on the **"Share"** button.
2. Click on the cogwheel icon and select **"Assign new owner"**. Choose the new owner of the dashboard.
3. Click on the **"Published"** icon next to the name of the dashboard, and switch to the **"Draft"** version. Click on the **"Publish"** button.
   - Choose from one of the two credential options:
     - **Embed credentials (default):** All viewers run queries using the owner's credentials and compute.
     - **Don't embed credentials:** Each viewer must have access to the workspace and associated data to view the dashboard.
       > We recommend using this option for more secure access control.
4. The dashboard can be shared with other team members by clicking the **"Share"** button from the **"Published"** mode.

<Admonition type="tip" title="Sharing Configuration">
Consider creating different sharing groups for executives vs. technical teams. Executives may only need view access, while technical teams may need access to drill down into details.
