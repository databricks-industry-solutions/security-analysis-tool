# GCP Installation

This guide will walk you through setting up the **Security Analysis Tool (SAT)** on GCP Databricks.

<Admonition type="warning" title="Unity Catalog Required">
**SAT v0.5.0 and higher requires Unity Catalog.** Make sure Unity Catalog is enabled in your Databricks environment before installing SAT.
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="tip" title="Best for Premium & Enterprise Tiers">
SAT is especially beneficial to customers on Databricks **Premium** or **Enterprise** tiers, as most checks and recommendations involve security features only available in these tiers.
</Admonition>

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- ✅ Reviewed the [general prerequisites](../../installation/index.mdx#prerequisites)
- ✅ Appropriate permissions in your GCP Cloud account
- ✅ A metastore attached to your installation workspace
- ✅ Databricks CLI installed and configured
- ✅ **Python version lower than 3.12** (for local installation using install.sh)

## Step 1: Create Service Principal

The Service Principal allows SAT to authenticate with your Databricks workspaces and collect security information.

<AccordionItem question="📋 How to create a Service Principal">

**Follow these steps in the Databricks Account Console:**

1. Navigate to the [GCP Account Console](https://accounts.gcp.databricks.com/)
2. Click on `User management` in the left sidebar
3. Select `Service Principal` → `Add service principal`
4. Enter a name for the service principal (e.g., "SAT-Service-Principal")
5. Grant the `Account Admin` role
6. Assign the `Workspace Admin` role for each workspace to be monitored
7. Add to the `Metastore Admin` group or role
8. Create a new OAuth Secret
9. **Save the `Secret` and `Client ID`** (you'll need these later)
10. Add the Service Principal to each workspace you want to analyze

</div>

**Required Permissions:**
- [Account Admin role](https://docs.gcp.databricks.com/en/admin/users-groups/service-principals.html#assign-account-admin-roles-to-a-service-principal)
- [Workspace Admin role](https://docs.gcp.databricks.com/en/admin/users-groups/service-principals.html#assign-a-service-principal-to-a-workspace-using-the-account-console) for **each workspace**
- [Metastore admin group](https://docs.gcp.databricks.com/en/data-governance/unity-catalog/manage-privileges/admin-privileges.html#who-has-metastore-admin-privileges) membership

## Step 2: Run Installation

<Admonition type="note" title="Credentials Required">
Have these credentials ready before starting:

- 🔑 **Databricks Account ID**
- 🔑 **Databricks Service Principal ID** (Client ID from Step 1)
- 🔑 **Databricks Service Principal Secret** (from Step 1)
</Admonition>

### Installation Steps

Run these commands on your workstation or a VM with internet access and Databricks workspace connectivity:

**1. Clone the SAT repository:**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/databricks-industry-solutions/security-analysis-tool.git
cd security-analysis-tool
```

<Admonition type="warning" title="Databricks CLI Required">
Make sure the target workspace has a [profile configured](https://docs.gcp.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/cli/profiles.html) in the [Databricks CLI](https://docs.gcp.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/cli/tutorial.html).
</Admonition>

**2. Make the installation script executable and run it:**

```sh
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

<Admonition type="tip" title="Proxy Support">
**Proxies are supported!** You can add your HTTP and HTTPS proxy values during the install.sh script when prompted.
</Admonition>

**3. Follow the interactive prompts:**

The installation script will guide you through the setup process. Here's what it looks like:
