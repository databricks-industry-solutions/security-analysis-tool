## Setting Up Terraform

<Admonition type="note" title="Note">
**SAT v0.2.0** or higher introduces full support for Unity Catalog. You can now pick your own catalog instead of being limited to the hive_metastore. Additionally, you have the flexibility to choose your own schema name.
</Admonition>

### Step 1: Install Required Tools
1. Install [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli).
2. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) on your local machine.

### Step 2: Clone the Repository
Clone the Security Analysis Tool repository using:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/databricks-industry-solutions/security-analysis-tool.git
``` 

### Step 3: Navigate to the Terraform Directory
Navigate to the relevant cloud directory:
```sh
cd security-analysis-tool/terraform/<cloud>/
``` 

### Step 4: Configure Variables
1. Create a `terraform.tfvars` file using the `template.tfvars` file as a base.
2. Refer to the `variables.tf` for descriptions of the variables.
3. Set all required variables for your deployment.

Further Documentation for some of the variables:

[workspace_id](https://docs.gcp.databricks.com/workspace/workspace-details.html#workspace-instance-names-urls-and-ids)

[account_console_id](https://docs.gcp.databricks.com/administration-guide/account-settings/#locate-your-account-id)

> **Proxies are now supported as part of SAT. You can add your HTTP and HTTPS links to use your proxies.**
```json
{
    "http": "http://example.com",
    "https": "https://example.com"
}
```

## Run Terraform and SAT Workflows

### Step 5: Run Terraform Commands
1. Initialize Terraform:
```sh
terraform init
```
2. Plan Terraform Changes - create a plan to preview changes to your infrastructure:
```sh
terraform plan
```
3. Apply Terraform Plan - Execute the proposed changes:
```sh
terraform apply
```
### Step 6: Run Databricks Jobs
1. Run "SAT Initializer Notebook":
* This must be run successfully once. While it can be run multiple times, a single successful run is sufficient.
2. Run "SAT Driver Notebook":
* This notebook can be scheduled to run periodically (e.g., every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday).

### Step 7: Access the SAT Dashboard
1. Navigate to the <b>SQL > Dashboard </b> in the left menu from the Databricks workspace.
2. Select the <b>SAT Dashboard</b>, choose a Workspace from the dropdown, and refresh the dashboard.

* [Databricks Terraform Provider Docs](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/databricks/databricks/latest/docs)

### Additional Considerations:

If a pre-existing secret scope named `sat_scope` causes jobs to fail:
1. Rename the secret scope in `secrets.tf`
2. Re-run `terraform apply`.
3. Update the secret scope name in 6 locations (`CMD 4` and `CMD 5`) of `Workspace -> Applications -> SAT-TF/notebooks/Utils/initialize`.
4. Re-run failed jobs

Congratulations! 🎉 You are now ready to start using the SAT. Please click [here](../../functionality.mdx) for a detailed description on how to run and use it.
