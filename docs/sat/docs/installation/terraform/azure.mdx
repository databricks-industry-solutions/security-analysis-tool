## Setting Up Terraform

<Admonition type="note" title="Note">
**SAT v0.2.0** or higher introduces full support for Unity Catalog. You can now pick your own catalog instead of being limited to the hive_metastore. Additionally, you have the flexibility to choose your own schema name.

</Admonition>

<Admonition type="note" title="Note">

SAT requires at least one SAT set up in a workspace per Azure **subscription**. 
</Admonition>


### Step 1: Install Required Tools
1. Install [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli).
2. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) on your local machine.

### Step 2: Clone the Repository
Clone the Security Analysis Tool repository using:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/databricks-industry-solutions/security-analysis-tool.git
``` 

### Step 3: Navigate to the Terraform Directory
Navigate to the relevant cloud directory:
```sh
cd security-analysis-tool/terraform/<cloud>/
``` 

### Step 4: Configure Variables
1. Create a `terraform.tfvars` file using the `template.tfvars` file as a base.
2. Refer to the `variables.tf` for descriptions of the variables.
3. Set all required variables for your deployment.

#### Azure-Specific Configuration
* Follow the [Azure Setup Guide](https://github.com/databricks-industry-solutions/security-analysis-tool/blob/main/docs/setup/azure.md) for variable setup.

#### Service Principal Role Requirements:
* "Reader" role at the subscription level via Access control (IAM).
* [Accounts Admin role](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/admin/users-groups/service-principals#--assign-account-admin-roles-to-a-service-principal)
* [Admin role](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/admin/users-groups/service-principals#assign-a-service-principal-to-a-workspace-using-the-account-console) for **each workspace**
* Member of the [metastore admin group](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/data-governance/unity-catalog/manage-privileges/admin-privileges#who-has-metastore-admin-privileges)

Refer to the documentation for [workspace_url](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/workspace/workspace-details#workspace-instance-names-urls-and-ids), [workspace_id](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/workspace/workspace-details#--workspace-instance-names-urls-and-ids), and [account_console_id](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/administration-guide/account-settings/#locate-your-account-id)

### Step 5: Configure Azure CLI Credentials
1. Set up [Azure CLI credentials](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli#sign-in-interactively) for the provider block in `provider.tf`.
2. Use the Azure CLI to log in. The CLI will open a web browser for authentication:
```sh
az login
```
> **Proxies are now supported as part of SAT. You can add your HTTP and HTTPS links to use your proxies.**
```json
{
    "http": "http://example.com",
    "https": "https://example.com"
}
```
## Run Terraform and SAT Workflows

### Step 6: Run Terraform Commands
1. Initialize Terraform:
```sh
terraform init
```
2. Plan Terraform Changes - create a plan to preview changes to your infrastructure:
```sh
terraform plan
```
3. Apply Terraform Plan - Execute the proposed changes:
```sh
terraform apply
```

### Step 7: Run Databricks Jobs
1. Run "SAT Initializer Notebook":
* This must be run successfully once. While it can be run multiple times, a single successful run is sufficient.
2. Run "SAT Driver Notebook":
* This notebook can be scheduled to run periodically (e.g., every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday).

### Step 8: Access the SAT Dashboard
1. Navigate to the <b>SQL > Dashboard </b> in the left menu from the Databricks workspace.
2. Select the <b>SAT Dashboard</b>, choose a Workspace from the dropdown, and refresh the dashboard.

### Supplemental Documentation

* [Databricks Documentation Terraform](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/terraform/index.html)
* [Databricks Terraform Provider Docs](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/databricks/databricks/latest/docs)

### Additional Considerations:

If a pre-existing secret scope named `sat_scope` causes jobs to fail:
1. Rename the secret scope in `secrets.tf`
2. Re-run `terraform apply`.
3. Update the secret scope name in 6 locations (`CMD 4` and `CMD 5`) of `Workspace -> Applications -> SAT-TF/notebooks/Utils/initialize`.
4. Re-run failed jobs
